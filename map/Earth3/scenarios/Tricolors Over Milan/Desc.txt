With the unifications of the Italian penisula and the German state, the world of TOM (Tricolors Over Milan), in 1861, is completely different from our timeline: with a more prominent power in the mediterranean and an early successfull union of German kingdoms, both of these nations seem to be destined to a common alliance. Meanwhile in the West, Britain and France are rapidly expanding their colonies in Africa, while farther west, the USA is experiencing high unrest due to the question of slave work. In the East, Russia seeks expanding into Central Asia and the Black Sea, while farther East, Japan has entered a new unified era for the archipelago, while China and Korea remain fixed in their isolationist views.
