The German Empire is a very recently born nation, but that doesn't stop it from being an industrial powerhouse: in fact it's currently the leading nation in continental europe in terms of industrialization, militarization and research. It's current goals and ambition are defeating Denmark in a war to "liberate" Schleswig-Holstein, building a powerful navy that can compete with Britain's and establish colonies, but first the state needs to reorganize internally, as the nation needs to build the "German identity" and integrate (or assimilate) all the people that were previously part of smaller independent states, aswell as building relations to search for new allies, since France and Austria are both out of the question, this only leaves Italy, Russia, the USA and Great Britain. How will you shape Germany's future?
