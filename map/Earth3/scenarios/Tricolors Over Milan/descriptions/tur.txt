The Ottoman Empire is a vast and multi-ethnic empire grappling with internal reforms and external pressures. Sultan Abdülmecid I sits on the throne, his greatest achievement so far has been the announcement of the Tanzimat Edict upon his accession, prepared by his then Foreign Minister Mustafa Reshid Pasha, which effectively began the reorganization of the Ottoman Empire in 1839. Abdülmecid was a mild-mannered monarch, giving the Sublime Porte the autonomy needed for its reform projects. One of the main goals of the Tanzimat was to encourage Ottomanism among the millets to stop rising nationalist movements within the empire, but despite new laws and reforms to integrate non-Muslims and non-Turks more thoroughly into Ottoman society, although these look to be failing. The grand capital, Constantinople, reflects the empire's complexities. The empire faces challenges on multiple fronts. Greek independence in the 1820s has inspired nationalist movements amongst other subject peoples, particularly in the Balkans. European powers like Britain, France, and Russia watch closely, eager to exploit any sign of weakness. The empire retains its vastness, stretching from North Africa to the Arabian Peninsula and deep into Eastern Europe. A diverse tapestry of cultures and religions co-exists, with varying degrees of tolerance. Trade remains a vital part of the economy, with bustling ports and caravan routes carrying goods across the empire and beyond. The Ottoman Empire in 1861 stands at a pivotal moment.
