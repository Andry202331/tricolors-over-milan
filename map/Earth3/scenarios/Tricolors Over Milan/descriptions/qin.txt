The Qing Dynasty stands at a peak of outward power, yet faces rumblings of internal discontent. Emperor Xianfeng, the fourth son of the Daoguang Emperor, assumed the throne in 1850 and inherited an empire in crisis. A few months after his ascension, the Taiping Rebellion broke out in southern China and rapidly spread, culminating in the fall of Nanjing in 1853. Contemporaneously, the Nian Rebellion began in the north, followed by ethnic uprisings (the Miao Rebellion and the Panthay Rebellion) in the south. The revolts ravaged large parts of the country, caused millions of deaths and would not be quelled until well into the reign of the Xianfeng Emperor's successor. With such a rebellious folk, and outdated government, can this dinasty really stand until the XX century?
