After the 1848 Hungarian revolution, Austria was weak, and the Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont didn't sit to watch, instead with a swift offensive with the help of the French military and other Italian states ones', the Italian War of Independence resulted in an impressive victory by the small kingdom and France, which would sign the treaty of Villafranca together with Austria. This treaty determined the annexation of Lombardy by the Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont and the creation of an independent Venetian state. After several diplomatic discussions and favourable wars, Italy was united in 1859, no longer oppressed by other nations and no longer a battlefield for the larger and powerful powers. In 1861, the Kingdom has mostly completed it's territorial goals of "Risorgimento" in Europe, and is now focusing on other matters such as colonialism: in fact King Victor Emanuel the II strongly favours the policy out of fear of remaining behind and losing out on valuable resources that could be useful to build up the nation. Another benefit would be prestige gain and power recognition by the other European Great Powers, and possibly surpass Austria to humiliate them even further. With already established colonial settlements in Tunisia and Lybia, this objective may not be too far from reality, although questions have been raised about slavery, now more than ever due to rising tensions within the United States about the same matter. With rapid advances in technologies and industrialization, Italy is currently the one lacking behind in these fields compared to Germany, France and Britain. The Kingdom currently relies on Art and exporting food to impress the Great Powers, but how long will that last? Will you be able to turn Italy around into an industrial powerhouse?
